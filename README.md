##Background

I am a game fun. I built this simple game to practice socket.io, mongoose, and passport. I think the project is also a prototype of Instant Messager app. And I want to add  an Artificial Intelligence algorithm in the server in the future.

##Use Case

Users can sign up, log in mongoDB, choose an online player to play. Server transfers informations between players, and interact with mongoDB to do users log in or sign up. If you wants to find an example to show how to use passport, socketio-auth, and mongoose model, this project helps you.

##Initial UX
